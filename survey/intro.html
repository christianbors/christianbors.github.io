<h4>Welcome to the evaluation of visualizing uncertainty in time series segments</h4>

<p>
The evaluation is split up into three chapters, with two sessions measuring your performance, and ending with a questionnaire to tell us your preferences on specific visualization designs.
</p>
<p>
The two performance evaluations will test different visualizations that should support you with:
<ul>
  <li>Decision making under the presence of uncertainty</li>
  <li>Finding evidence for sources of uncertainty</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h4>What does this mean?</h4>
<p>Sometimes, data is affected by uncertainty. Showing this uncertainty to the end user (you!) allows them to assess if the results can be trusted. This is due to different factors. Uncertainty can be introduced (and also measured) at different levels:
<ul>
<li>At recording</li>
<li>When modelling data</li>
<li>During processing data</li>
<li>When visualizing data</li>
</ul>
As a result, we can visualize uncertainty at different levels, which gives us insights if problems exist at certain states of the data.</p>
<h4>The data</h4>
<p>We analyze multivariate time series, so a time series measurements with multiple dimensions.
